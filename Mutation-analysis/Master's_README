Dystrophin_ABD1
Some code from my Master's research on elucidating the disease mechanism for Muscular Dystrophy by studying the unfolding of 
the ABD1 region of Dystrophin.

A breif overview: In a 2018 publication in the Biophysical journal 
(link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30007583, title: Dynamics of Dystrophin's Actin-Binding Domain.)
I determined to study the ABD1 region of Dystrophin because of the high density of disease causing mutations. 
Furthermore, I measured a significant difference in the calculated change in heat capacities of the disease casuing mutations
suggesting that the folded stability of the ABD1 region might have a major role in the proper functioning of ABD1. The paper 
explores these avenues.

This repository compiles the code I used to make these analyses which I originally did in R as well as the analysis of the 
thermodynamics of ABD1 unfolding which I also wrote in R.

This code is provided for the purpose of reproducibility on the part of other researchers interested in studying MD or for 
those interested in the mutation analysis or thermodynamic analysis produced for this study.
